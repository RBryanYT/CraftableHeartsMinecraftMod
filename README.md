# Craftable Hearts
This mod lets you craft extra hearts!

*by RBryanYT*

`Forge 1.19.2 - Version 1.1`
## Regular Hearts
You have to craft heart fragments to craft a regular heart.

Using fragments, you can craft hearts that you right-click to get good effects for 5 seconds. And give you an extra heart in your healthbar!
## Poisoned Hearts
You can add some ingredients to a regular heart to poison it.

**Don't claim this!** It will give you bad effects for 10 seconds. And it removes a heart from your healthbar!
### WARNING
DO NOT USE POISON HEARTS TO EMPTY YOUR HEALTHBAR. YOU **WILL** BE **PERMANENTLY** BANNED. YOU CAN'T BE UNBANNED!

## Secretive Poison
You can add more ingredients to a poison heart to make it a secret poison heart.

This looks like a regular heart, but when you claim it, it acts like a poison heart!

It still removes a heart and gives bad effects for 10 seconds.
